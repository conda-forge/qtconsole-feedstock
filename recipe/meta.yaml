  summary: Jupyter Qt console
  description: |
    A rich Qt-based console for working with Jupyter kernels, supporting rich
    media output, session export, and more. The Qt console is a very
    lightweight application that largely feels like a terminal, but provides
    a number of enhancements only possible in a GUI, such as inline figures,
    proper multiline editing with syntax highlighting, graphical calltips, and
    more.
